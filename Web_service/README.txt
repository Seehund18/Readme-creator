Thanks to Spring Boot, all that is needed is to package app into jar via Maven using "mvn clean package" and just run "Web_service-0.1.0.jar" (better to run jar via console to see all messages and control application). Note that Spring Boot starts Tomcat under the hood on "localhost:8080", so it's possible that some app is already running on your 8080 port and Tomcat will clashes with it.

deploy.bat in this folder will create deployment directory with start.bat. You have to only run that script.
